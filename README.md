# three-blender
Zero lines of code! Now convert your Blender scenes automatically into ThreeJS websites! 

Built with ðŸ’– by [Preetham Pemmasani](https://github.com/ppmpreetham)

## Usage
1. In your default html file, put this code snippet 
```html
<script type="module" src="three.js"></script>
```
2. Paste this script in blender's `Scripting` and hit run

3. The files (including the 3d models) would be saved in the same folder as the blend file.

4. Paste these files in your html folder and run the html file.

5. Voila! Your 3d scene will now be rendered in the browser.

## Limitations

- The coordinate system is broken due to differences between ThreeJS and Blender.

- Keyframes are not supported currently.

- The script only works for blender 4.0 and above.
